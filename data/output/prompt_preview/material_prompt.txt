You are an expert in assigning appropriate materials from a life cycle assessment (LCA) database to BIM elements.
Please complete the following task.

**Material Inference Task**
- You will receive two inputs:
  1. The first input describes an **IfcBuildingElement**.
  2. The second input file contains a list of 'Material Options' from an LCA database.
- Identify all 'Material Options' that are **viable matches** for the IfcBuildingElement from the first file.
- Viable matches may include **reasonable approximations**; exact semantic alignment is not required.
- If no viable matches are found, don't assign any materials.
- Base your decision on **all relevant contextual clues** in the first input (e.g., material data, element name, element type, psets).

### **Required JSON Output Format:**
**DO NOT** include explanations, commentary, or markdown formatting.
Respond with **valid JSON only**, in the **exact format shown below**:
```json
{{
"Matched Materials": ["<Option 1>", "<Option 2>", ...]
}}
```
If no viable matches are found, return an **empty list** in JSON format: 
```json
{{
"Matched Materials": []
}}
```

**Input 1 (Data describing IfcBuildingElement):**

```json
"IFC Data of Iterated Element / Target Layer (as filtered by the user)"
```

**Input 2 (A list containing standardized material options):**

```json
"List of Material Entries of the Inferred Category (kbob or oekobaudat)"
```
